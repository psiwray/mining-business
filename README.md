# Mining Business
The game _Mining Business_ is a game where you own a mining company and you need to keep up the activity involving this society. At first you can **dig** by yourself to get minerals that can be sold at the _local market_, then, when you've got the money to buy things such as _structures and machines_, you can delegate the work to them. Each month (virtually 10 minutes) the **money** used for _structures_, _machines_, _electricity_ and so on are removed from your society's _money stock_. If you reach a negative stock number, after a defined amount the game is **lost**. The game has no end, and the map is infinite. The map is even randomly generated. The player has the opportunity to choose the continent where he will be digging and that concurs to modify some game factors such as a particular mineral quantity percentage.

There will probably going to be implemented even a **networked multiplayer**, a **global market** involving other mining companies controlled by the CPU, and every other nice feature that comes up to my mind. Actually, all this is not going to be included in the project, it'll only be if enough time is left to be dedicated to the project.
